 ## :arrow_right: *DAY 1 (12/07/2020)*
### *Installation of the linux*
Today I made a bootable usb drive by downloading the Linux ubuntu  ISO in that and the running it on my machine (laptop)
The very next task was to install the lamp on the linux ubuntu and hosting a localhost asthe test result, this was initially giving some problems in the installation but then at last was just able  to run all the commands fro teh installation and the problem then came was to host it locally some commands which were optional of the php were also executed by me. when there was any problem in the execution of any command I refer to Stackoverflow site https://stackoverflow.com/ to find the  aulternative command. This activity  took about one day.

## :arrow_right: *DAY 2 (13/07/2020)*

Read about the frappe framework, its functionalities and advantage along with its installation process. Beside that looked over the lamp that was told to install earlier.
## :arrow_right: * DAY 3 (14/07/2020)*
Went on to the frappe framework offficial page and headed with the  installation process and kept on recovering the erros. This activity took about 2 days.then we found another souces fro teh installation of the framework because theh version of the linux was not compactable with the official instructions. The then used instructionn manual was(https://github.com/D-codE-Hub/Guide-to-Install-Frappe-ERPNext-in-Ubuntu-22.04-LTS) for the proper installation of the later.
##  :arrow_right: * DAY 4 (18/07/2020)*
As the frappe was installed, the futher reading process about the usage of the framework was done. the LIBERARY MANAGMENT SYSTEM was initialted and the doctypes were created, beside that the Markdown lanuage was also read and the cheatsheets were read to know about the different tags in the later language. This took us 2 days.

##  :arrow_right: * DAY 7 (20/07/2020)*
Today faces a very bad problem where my bios was stucked and *grub not found* was the error name :worried: . The only solution for this problem on the internet I was able to find was to delete my both microsoft and ubuntu and again relocate the grub and play the same game again, though did those before so it took me less time than before to reach the previous days progress

##  :arrow_right: * DAY 8,9 
After the completion of the liberary managment system we sat with the 2nd year sudents to listen their presentation on the various tasks being given to them. On 8th the presentation was on the markdown language tags and their usage with some examples. On the very next day there was anouncement for the next presentation which was on DBMS sub topic of normal forms. I have read this subject so, I was able to make questions from the presentation,beside this there was a prpblem in explaining the terms like different types of keys by the 2nd year student as they seemed bit confused but Prof. Satinder Sir made the concept clear to them and other members.
##  :arrow_right: * DAY 10
This day there was another presentation on the static website by Raghav i.e there was a website given by Rai sir to Raghav to convert it to satic form, by the help of the flags he was succesfully was able to do that
##  :arrow_right: * DAY 11 
Some student came to me afternoon as they had some problem for the setting of the dual boot bootloader for their laptops
##  :arrow_right: * DAY 12
Back to basis.... Started taking in account the liberay managment system i.e how does the script worked for the transistions and mainting the memberships and can we wheather write this same thing in the frontend or the backend is  the only option for this framework.
##  :arrow_right: * DAY 13
This was the day when while sitting in the presentation in the computation lab sir asked for the interest in the project. I raised my hand and Quadratic equation was given to me. Back home I started making approaches for the same and thought of every way i can do,by this time as we have done LMS so was only knowing about writting code in the backend and started implementing the idea's I finallized. That was the day in SDC when I did not slept as my work finished at around 5 and that was the time my have to go for my training but was not felling tired at all.
##  :arrow_right: * DAY 14
The First presentation, was but nervous but thought what could go bad as I did all the questioning in my mind, But the excited students of 2nd year jsut throw their question at once, that god the code included the functionality to handle the iota values and Then I was little relaxed. Some more work was given in extention to this project.
##  :arrow_right: * DAY 15 
This day I was bit upset about my laptop as i was new to linux system and there was the problem that my wifi module was not being recoganized by the ubuntu OS. After all possible efforts I decided to use Arch linux and then installed an ISO file of endavour and installed it. After 2 hrs of the use I decided that was not my type kinnda destro so switchedd to parrot sec version along side.
##  :arrow_right: * DAY 16
From previous day side by side I was also doing the finance related work. This was a work given to me by the Prof. Satinder. The exact was not being cleared to me because there were series of task being involved in this work. I decided to work on all of that and report that the next day. But at night 1 o'clock I realised that frappe is kind of stuff that needs more that one night.
##  :arrow_right: * DAY 17
New member were welcomed and they asked to update their laptops with the ubuntu operating system and tell them something and guide them, told them to do something in the markdown. 
##  :arrow_right: * DAY 18 
Met my class mate who came late in SDC Tanvir, then he made alot of diffence in the working condition of the group:- use of anaconda, virtual environment, resolve a linux problem, finding the solution to the problems related to installation of the frappe and many more. Before him we all did one stupid thing to make thing right i.e delete and reinstall.
##  :arrow_right: * DAY 19
Now this was the time to make a system administrator yes Tanvir offered his services for the same and a gne11 was setup for the same, on which we can work show the progress
##  :arrow_right: * DAY 20
Today I worked along side for the mentor mentee project, finding scripts and making some corection in the former ones and did 3 meeting with satinder sir for the same and gave differnt ideas to use the normal form for this work
##  :arrow_right: * DAY 21
Today was a less productive day, we installed some firewalls updated of cc1,cc2,cc3 and SL1, SL2, and some more labs of MBA block
##  :arrow_right: * DAY 22
Presentation was given on the ededucation domain as this was the work given to each member of the team. My task here was to make the fee structure for NSPS gill and take the fees from the student under different coditions like discount to his sibling and mamy more discounts
##  :arrow_right: * DAY 23
I made a question about regarding the fee structure on the ERP forum and waited to recieve some replies form them https://discuss.erpnext.com/t/re-discount-at-fee-structure/94185 , replies come but late that is why patient and hope is needed
##  :arrow_right: * DAY 24
Exams time Infosys and company exam was there prepared DS for the same
##  :arrow_right: * DAY 25
Again sat on the mentor mentee project and made some sugestions usefull or not deepak woould know that, went home early

##  :arrow_right: * DAY 26
Charts a topic that is a task of its kind, hard to understand but beautiful to look was given under the domain of the quadreatic equation,
I again made a quaratic equation but this time tried to make the web page for the same so that guest can come and make his calculations easily

##  :arrow_right: * DAY 27,28 
The task took too many attempt but was not able to meet the requirements such as the values must not be stored in the data base but the issue was that the thing that i could understand from the charts is make the graphical representation from the data stored in the data base
##  :arrow_right: * Next Week
 This whole weak droped the work of the quadratic equation as  the primary task I could suspect that was the fee structure of the NSPS gill that was to be delievered to the school. The students were uploaded and the work begine it took some days to figure out how to make the structure for the fees and how to render the discounts to the students based on the data that was delievered to us by the school itself, for this very reason as suggested by Sir I asked the EPR forum for the help but by the time could notice that many other people need that same discount thing; this was one attempt, the other was to replicate the discount structure as that of the sales invoice so tries to make that also much was done but the working was not as the way we expected it to be, so we fall backed to the original idea to make seperate structres for the different group of student.
 ##  :arrow_right: * Day 6
 Today we completed the fees work upto the was we were able to do then now the task assigned to me was to make the system to take payment of the fee form teh students form the differnt modes and show the same to the accounts sections. This work required the API keys and should be done throught the razorpay so Prof. Satinder Sir gave that keys and inintiated the work. Before doing this I  thought to see wheather the manuall fee payment was able to show in the accounts ledgure or not. This was the time I understood that account is not that easy game. The 1000 rupees payment which was made lost in the ERP itself. took 2 days to find where the money is going and what was te flow. For this I was adviced to make the company and see the same.
 ##  :arrow_right: * DAY 7,8,9,10
 Made the company, but then again was told to complete the work of quadratic equation and then I again came back to the old task. This was the time when I realised that I have not made any report of my previous work which took me alot of time to make the new script from scratch. Took less time than before as by now I was quite aware of the scripting language of the frappe the functions and many other things like jinja template. I also took help from the telegram group and then I was able to make that script again. This time I posted the script in GD as i was quite afraid to loose it again.                                                              I then took some leaves for the urgent visit to himachal.
##  :arrow_right: * DAY 15
After the return there was a little rush for the project of NSPS, So I was asked to make a clear review of the money flow to keep ensuring that the work done was absolutly right and no problem should be there while the presentation. This was the time when other team has to optain the querry from the database and send to our team so as to display the same on frappe in the form of the grade book and this time I gave my time and helpd the team to find the querry but was not able to do so then Prof. Satinder Sir helped then to find the querry.
##  :arrow_right: * DAY 16,17
These two day were sent to find the problem in the accounting and then A mail came of Rai sir asking me to amke a company and see the sales quatations and everyhting, He said that it would helpfull for the other workes also and understanding the structure of frappe nmore clearly.
##  :arrow_right: * DAY 18
These days were spent on making company and then I was not able to make the accounts setting then Rai sir gave us a video and In that video each and every task were given with a clear detail with the help of the spread sheet.
##  :arrow_right: * DAY 19 
Now Abhinav also came to this work and he did it seperately and I did it sepertatly, he made Abhinav chai wala and mine name was SAMSON
The report work of the PAYMENT GATEWAY was pending so i finished that and send the report to review
##  :arrow_right: * DAY 20
Rai sir gave me a work on making a report on ER diagram and this work was given to me as we were not able to make a ER diagrame from the PHP myadmin platform 
So back home i did this work and presented the report to the team the very next day and uploaded the same on gne2 webpage 
##  :arrow_right: * DAY 21
The report which was uploaded to the gne2 webpage was then experimented by me, by using different themes using some bootstrap ( also askedd other GD members to do teh same but the did not find that interesting I guess and then I reminded them to review the ER diagram report that was also not done, Just abhinav did an made some commits on it. During this task I found some good page builders on frappe to work with
