### *Installation of the linux*
Today I made a bootable usb drive by downloading the Linux ubuntu  ISO in that and the running it on my machine (laptop)
The very next task was to install the lamp on the linux ubuntu and hosting a localhost asthe test result, this was initially giving some problems in the installation but then at last was just able  to run all the commands fro teh installation and the problem then came was to host it locally some commands which were optional of the php were also executed by me. when there was any problem in the execution of any command I refer to Stackoverflow site https://stackoverflow.com/ to find the  aulternative command. This activity  took about one day.

## :arrow_right: *DAY 2 (13/07/2020)*

Read about the frappe framework, its functionalities and advantage along with its installation process. Beside that looked over the lamp that was told to install earlier.
## :arrow_right: * DAY 3 (14/07/2020)*
Went on to the frappe framework offficial page and headed with the  installation process and kept on recovering the erros. This activity took about 2 days.then we found another souces fro teh installation of the framework because theh version of the linux was not compactable with the official instructions. The then used instructionn manual was(https://github.com/D-codE-Hub/Guide-to-Install-Frappe-ERPNext-in-Ubuntu-22.04-LTS) for the proper installation of the later.
##  :arrow_right: * DAY 4 (18/07/2020)*
As the frappe was installed, the futher reading process about the usage of the framework was done. the LIBERARY MANAGMENT SYSTEM was initialted and the doctypes were created, beside that the Markdown lanuage was also read and the cheatsheets were read to know about the different tags in the later language. This took us 2 days.

##  :arrow_right: * DAY 7 (20/07/2020)*
Today faces a very bad problem where my bios was stucked and *grub not found* was the error name :worried: . The only solution for this problem on the internet I was able to find was to delete my both microsoft and ubuntu and again relocate the grub and play the same game again, though did those before so it took me less time than before to reach the previous days progress

##  :arrow_right: * DAY 8,9 
After the completion of the liberary managment system we sat with the 2nd year sudents to listen their presentation on the various tasks being given to them. On 8th the presentation was on the markdown language tags and their usage with some examples. On the very next day there was anouncement for the next presentation which was on DBMS sub topic of normal forms. I have read this subject so, I was able to make questions from the presentation,beside this there was a prpblem in explaining the terms like different types of keys by the 2nd year student as they seemed bit confused but Prof. Satinder Sir made the concept clear to them and other members.

This was the day when while sitting in the presentation in the computation lab sir asked for the interest in the project. I raised my hand and Quadratic equation was given to me. Back home I started making approaches for the same and thought of every way i can do,by this time as we have done LMS so was only knowing about writting code in the backend and started implementing the idea's I finallized. That was the day in SDC when I did not slept as my work finished at around 5 and that was the time my have to go for my training but was not felling tired at all.
##  :arrow_right: * DAY 14
The First presentation, was but nervous but thought what could go bad as I did all the questioning in my mind, But the excited students of 2nd year jsut throw their question at once, that god the code included the functionality to handle the iota values and Then I was little relaxed. Some more work was given in extention to this project.

This day I was bit upset about my laptop as i was new to linux system and there was the problem that my wifi module was not being recoganized by the ubuntu OS.

After 2 hrs of the use I decided that was not my type kinnda destro so switchedd to parrot sec version along side.

From previous day side by side I was also doing the finance related work. This was a work given to me by the Prof. Satinder.
